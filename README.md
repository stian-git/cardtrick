## Description

My first ever JavaScript project, built before I had any Javascript training at all.

This is a classic card trick where you need to remember a card and the game will magically identify it.

I got inspired to make this by watching a video of someone who demonstrated the use of the DeckofCards API to build a Blackjack-game. [(https://codepen.io/mjphillip)](https://codepen.io/mjphillip)

I selected this trick because it is easy, and there is no cheating. In theory you could use your own deck and follow along during the trick and get the same result. By adding animations on dealing and undealing of the cards, I probably could have improved the user experience, but the trick is still the same.

Some features:

- Magically Reveals your card
- Cards Retrived through API
- Swap cards is possible
- Restart feature available

## Built with

- [Deck of Cards API](http://deckofcardsapi.com/)
